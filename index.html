      <h2>
        0ClipBoard is a free online tool that help you to Copy and Retrieve Text
        between any devices. Just copy the text and share the ID. If you want to
        edit the Text in future, give -e in the end of your Clipboard ID while
        creating one.
      </h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of the clipboard, a software feature often offered by the
        operating system, is to use copy and paste actions to temporarily store
        data and transfer data between files or apps. It is one of the features
        that is most frequently used in a GUI environment. It is typically
        implemented as a temporary, anonymous data buffer that is accessible via
        the programming interface to the majority or all of the applications
        present in the environment. The user interface of typical apps will
        offer clipboard functions using hotkeys, menu options, and other means.
      </p>

      <p>
        The clipboard typically works online on a single device, although people
        are increasingly likely to utilise many devices while working these
        days. Sending a brief text message or image to another device is fairly
        challenging. With brief messages, using email or other tools is
        excessive. We developed this tool for this reason. On each operating
        system, as well as sometimes in different versions of the same operating
        system, the clipboard is implemented differently. They may also alter
        due to different programmes or user settings. The majority of
        environments only allow for one clipboard action, and each time content
        is "cut" or "copied," the prior version is overwritten.
      </p>

      <p>
        Data was initially stored in the clipboard as plain text without any
        meta-information, such as font, style, or colour. The storage of
        complicated data structures is made possible by later versions that
        support numerous data types. Styled text contains diverse bitmaps,
        vector images, electronic spreadsheets, database entries, RTF, HTML, and
        other formats. Nevertheless, at the moment, only two images and plain
        text are supported by Online Clipboard; additional features will be
        added in the future.
